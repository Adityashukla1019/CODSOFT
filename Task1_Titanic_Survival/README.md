# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Objective
To predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Encoding categorical features
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
6. Model evaluation and comparison

## ✅ Results
Random Forest achieved better accuracy compared to Logistic Regression, improving survival prediction performance.
